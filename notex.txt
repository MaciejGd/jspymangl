added indexing to tokens and nodes (identifiers)
 
idea:
    -> creating list of nodes that was previously declared, this tokens would be candidates to mangling
        it is about functions as well as variables
    -> during parsing we will add value as 
    Symbols indicating mangling:
        -> primary expression starting with let
        -> parseObjectProperty -> parsing object property
        -> parseObjectPropertyKey(used in cases like get or set in object, we want to mangle this)
        -> parseVariableIdentifier (variable/function/object initialization pattern)
    Symbols that are not candidates:
        -> id next to async keyword
        -> parsePropertyPattern (for now as it needs more testing)

[NEED FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND TESTING] search for this comment to see possible code issues
more testing:
    parsePropertyPattern
    parseObjectProperty -> second id
